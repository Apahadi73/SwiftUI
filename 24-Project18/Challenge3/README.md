## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/layout-and-geometry-wrap-up):
>For a real challenge make the letter count images in project 5 change color as you scroll. For the best effect, you should create colors using the Color(red:green:blue:) initializer, feeding in values for whichever of red, green, and blue you want to modify. The values to input can be figured out using the rowâ€™s current position divided by maximum position, which should give you values in the range 0 to 1.
